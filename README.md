## Description

### What is Pinpoint?
Pinpoint is a dedicated space to help you track your goals while staying focused and motivated. Feature-wise, users can choose from four colour themes, sort goals by levels, break them down into to-do lists, and monitor progress with a progress bar.


### Technologies used

I have used React for this project:

- I was able to create reusable components for the saved goals.
- Create and maintain state in the parent component and pass it down to the child components.
- Iâ€™ve used callback functions in child components to modify the goals state in the parent component. 

## Implementations for the future

- Toggle to turn off the countdown to the end of the year.
- Drag and drop to rearrange goals.
- Countdown for individual goal deadlines.
